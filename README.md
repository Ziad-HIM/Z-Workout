ZWorkout: Because "No Pain, No Gain" is a Little Harsh

Look no further than ZWorkout! This web app lets you create your own custom workouts and build a weekly plan that's guaranteed to keep you motivated (and maybe a little bit sore). 😉

Here's what ZWorkout offers:

- Add your favorite workouts: Name them, set the duration, and watch them magically appear in your workout plan. 🏋️‍♀️

- Create a weekly schedule: Choose a workout for each day of the week, or just chill out with a "Rest" day. 😴

- Edit your workouts: Option to edit the name and duration! 😊 

Note: AI (ChatGPT) was consulted for assistance in the some aspects of this project, but no code was directly copy-pasted (I had the idea and the logic, but did not know how to "word" it). The comments seen throughout the code are automatically generated by a feature in Replit (they suggest comments, and I can click enter to keep them). All work in this project is original, motivated by a desire to create a webiste to help with my gym passions :)
